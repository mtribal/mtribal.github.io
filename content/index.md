Welcome to the start of my blog! If you don't know already, my name is Miguel √Ångel Tribaldos and I'm a computer engineer.

It has been my goal to start this blog up for some time now. Why? To share my experiences as I use new frameworks, libraries, and tooling in my projects. My hope is that this will help us all (including myself) learn and encourage discussion to find the best approaches to complex problems.

I'll have more for you soon!
